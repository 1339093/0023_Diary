This is a study note about **CASA0023** Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments

In this note, I will record my weekly study notes and contents weekly.

My undergraduate degree is in Data Science and Big Data Technology. Have some basic knowledge of python, R language and some machine learning applications. But for remote sensing, I am a complete newbie.

The reason why I chose this course, besides the interest aspect. The main reason is because I think remote sensing data is very important for either urban space or other spaces, and a lot of modelling requires remote sensing data. Therefore, understanding-learning-mastering remote sensing data is very important for the future.

I believe this [book]{.text-green} can clearly show my learning results. It may not be **perfect**, but it also represents my efforts.

**My goal** is to present my own notes while being as interesting as possible and, of course, easy to understand. This is not only for better [review]{.text-red}, but also for people who have no contact with the field at all to understand and become interested.
