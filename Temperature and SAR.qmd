## Summary

This week's topic focused on analysing urban temperatures through remote sensing, using a combination of Landsat and MODIS data. The goal was to explore how surface temperature patterns can be extracted, monitored over time, and interpreted through statistical and machine learning methods. We also learned how to calculate the Heat Index and considered the role of historical redlining policies in shaping temperature disparities across urban areas.

In practice, we used Landsat 8 and MODIS (Aqua & Terra) data to extract the Land Surface Temperature (LST) of Beijing. Landsat provided high spatial detail, while MODIS offered frequent temporal coverage. Processing was conducted in Google Earth Engine (GEE), which streamlined tasks such as data selection, cloud masking, and regional averaging.

To better understand how these two datasets complement each other, I created the comparison below:

| Feature             | Landsat 8                          | MODIS (Aqua & Terra)                     |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Spatial Resolution  | 30m (thermal: resampled from 100m) | 1km (LST product), 250â€“500m (optical)    |
| Temporal Resolution | 16 days                            | 2 observations per day                   |
| Strength            | High spatial detail                | High temporal coverage                   |
| Use Case            | Local-scale thermal mapping        | Long-term UHI and climate trend analysis |

What I enjoyed most this week was working with time-series data and combining it with spatial analysis. Using MODIS to look at summer temperature trends over time, and Landsat to calculate average LST for different districts. After exporting the data, I analysed it in R, looking at things like percentiles and classifying urban heat risk based on that. It gave me a much clearer picture of how urban heat isn't just a physical issue, but one that's deeply connected to planning and equity.

## Application

This week's knowledge can be widely applied to **Urban Heat Island (UHI) studies, environmental planning, and climate adaptation strategies**.

-   *Urban Heat Island Effect Monitoring*

    This week, we learnt how to use MODIS long time series data to analyse the trend of urban heat island effect, and combined with Landsat fine-grained data to study microclimate impacts. By comparing data from different years, it is possible to identify areas of significant temperature increase and further explore the relationship with land use change, such as which neighbourhoods are more susceptible to heat due to a lack of greenery.

-   *Urban planning and public health*

    High temperatures not only affect comfort, but are also linked to socio-economic factors and the health of the population. We will examine the long-term impact of â€˜Redliningâ€™ policies in the context of heat exposure in poor neighbourhoods, and use hospital emergency data to assess the public health risks of heat, in order to develop more appropriate cooling strategies for cities.

-   *Data Processing and Machine Learning*

    Optimisation This week's heat index calculation is similar to a classification problem and can be combined with K-means clustering, decision trees (CART) or deep learning (CNN) to improve the accuracy of the analysis. In addition, temperature trend analyses via Mann-Kendall trend tests can provide data to support future urban planning and policy making.

**ðŸ’¡:**\
Landsat has high spatial resolution but low temporal resolution, suitable for local fine analysis; MODIS has high temporal resolution but low spatial resolution, suitable for large-scale analysis.\
The calculation of the heat index can be adjusted, e.g. different regions may need different temperature thresholds to avoid â€˜one size fits allâ€™ grading.\
In the future, **Night temperature data (MODIS LST Night)** can be added to explore the influence of day-night temperature difference on the thermal environment.

## Reflection

This week has made me more aware of the importance of remotely sensed data in urban environmental monitoring, especially in addressing climate change and urban heat island issues, which can provide more comprehensive and detailed analyses than traditional weather stations. In addition, the high temporal resolution of MODIS makes me more interested in time series analysis, and in the future I would like to try to apply machine learning to temperature prediction, such as **LSTM or ARIMA** to predict the future high temperature trend of the city.

However, the whole data processing process is still quite complicated, especially when implementing temperature calculation, heat index grading and other operations in **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**, the code logic needs to be adjusted repeatedly. If we want to do a larger-scale analysis of the urban thermal environment in the future, we may need to combine Python with automated batch processing to improve the computational efficiency.

This week's study has given me a deeper understanding of **Geospatial Data Processing and Time Series Analysis**, and a clearer idea of the direction in which remote sensing technology may be applied in the future!
