Although I was a bit confused at first, the more I learnt, the more interesting it became. Especially the SAR data, its penetrating ability simply caught my eyes! In a place like London, where it is always cloudy, SAR is a lifesaver, as it can penetrate the clouds and see what is happening on the ground surface, which will definitely be useful in disaster monitoring and climate change research. Although I am still a bronze player, I think I will be able to reach the gold level one day as long as I keep upgrading my skills!\nWhen it comes to my future research direction, I studied computer science in my undergraduate degree, so I am particularly interested in seeing how machine learning can be applied to remote sensing data analysis. For example, deep learning models can be used to automatically identify the type of ground cover or predict the trend of environmental change. Nowadays, the volume of remote sensing data is so large that manual analysis alone is definitely not enough, and if AI can be used to help, the efficiency will definitely be greatly improved. Moreover, machine learning can also discover some patterns from the data that we can’t see with the naked eye, which feels especially cool!\nAlso, like I mentioned above, can remote sensing technology be used in combination with other fields in the future? For example, combining remote sensing data with social media data to monitor disasters in real time. Or, integrating drone data with satellite data for both a detailed and wide view. These ideas may be premature now, but I think they are definitely possible in the future!\nAll in all, this week’s study has given me a deeper understanding of remote sensing technology and given me more ideas for future research directions. Although there is still a long way to go, I am ready to fight and upgrade!",

For example, atmospheric correction can be used to improve the accuracy of remotely sensed data, especially in cloudy or heavily atmospherically polluted areas. With image enhancement techniques, we can better identify surface features such as vegetation cover, water distribution and urban sprawl.\nIn the literature\nMany studies have used atmospheric correction and image enhancement techniques to improve the quality of remotely sensed data. For example, some studies have used DOS methods to correct Landsat data to improve the accuracy of vegetation indices such as NDVI. However, there are some limitations to these methods, such as the fact that DOS methods may not be able to completely remove atmospheric effects when atmospheric conditions are complex.\n💡:\nCan remote sensing data correction and enhancement techniques be used in areas other than traditional environmental monitoring? For example, in urban planning, corrected remote sensing data are used to assess the urban heat island effect.\nThere have been some applications in the literature: the surface radiation temperature of Shenzhen City was inverted using the Split Window Algorithm (SWA) and the Atmospheric Correction Method (ARC).\nReference：Zhang Xiaomin,Liu Zhiwei,Fang Han,et al. Spatial and temporal distribution of urban heat island effect and land use impacts in Shenzhen based on Landsat 8 TIRS surface temperature data inversion[J].

Especially the atmospheric correction, although I found it a bit difficult to understand at first, but through the DOS method, I slowly understood its basic principles and was able to get my hands on it.\nCan these techniques be combined with AI in the future? For example, using AI to automatically identify which areas require more complex atmospheric corrections, or using machine learning models to predict which image enhancement methods are best suited to a particular surface feature. This would not only improve efficiency, but also make the processing of remote sensing data smarter.\nIt also occurs to me that remote sensing data correction and enhancement techniques could be combined with VR or AR?\nFor example, the corrected remote sensing data can be imported into a VR environment, so that researchers or decision makers can ‘walk into’ the remote sensing images and visualise the changes on the ground surface. Or using AR technology to overlay remote sensing data onto the real world to help urban planners better understand the impacts of urban sprawl.

I chose Singapore because it is a highly urbanised island nation that faces a number of climate and environmental challenges, such as rising sea levels, urban heat island effect, and land resource constraints. To address these issues, the Singapore government has developed the Singapore Master Plan (SMP), one of the key objectives of which is to promote sustainable urban development.\nIn this process, remote sensing data can play a big role, such as monitoring urban sprawl, evaluating green space coverage, and analysing changes in the coastline. Although I seldom pay attention to these ‘macro’ issues in my daily life, this assignment made me realise that satellite data are actually closely related to our urban life and can even influence the government’s decisions.",

Monitoring urban sprawl\nSingapore’s land is very limited, and urbanisation and development can affect natural ecosystems such as forests, wetlands and even coastlines. I found that these changes can be analysed using Landsat multi-temporal imagery to see just how much urbanisation is affecting the environment. For example, the government can use this data to decide which areas need ecological protection and which can be used for development.\n2. Assessing urban greenery and the heat island effect\nWalking on a concrete road in summer, you can really feel the temperature much higher than in a park, which is the Urban Heat Island Effect (UHI). Through the NDVI (Normalised Vegetation Index), we can see the green coverage of Singapore and identify areas with less vegetation and higher temperatures. In this way, the government can target more green spaces, such as planting more trees and promoting rooftop greening, to lower the temperature.\n3. Monitoring Sea Level Rise\nAs an island nation, Singapore’s coastline will be affected by climate change. Changes in the coastline can be analysed using Sentinel-1 SAR data to see which areas may be threatened by sea level rise. This will enable the government to plan ahead, such as reinforcing seawalls and protecting mangroves, which are natural protective barriers.\nData Reference:\nLandsat: Monitoring urban sprawl and land use change.\nSentinel-2: Analysing vegetation cover and assessing urban green spaces.\nSentinel-1SAR: Monitoring Sea Level Rise and Assessing Coastal Risks",

Remote sensing data is useful but has its limitations.\nI thought that remote sensing data is ‘real time’, but in fact it is affected by weather, data update frequency and other factors, sometimes it may not reflect the latest situation immediately. For example, optical remote sensing (Landsat, Sentinel-2) is difficult to use in cloudy weather, which made me realise why Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is so important because it is not affected by weather. There is also the fact that data processing is not simple, and after the government acquires the data, it needs professionals to analyse and interpret it before it can really be used for decision making.\n2. The Power of Remote Sensing Data\nThis assignment really made me realise that data can shape a city. Government decisions are not made out of thin air, but are based on a variety of data, such as remote sensing imagery, ground measurements, and even social data. It’s like Singapore’s master plan is not decided arbitrarily, but through data analysis and trend prediction to find the most reasonable development direction. For example, they use remote sensing to monitor the green coverage rate and find areas where parks need to be added; they use coastline data to predict sea level rise and decide where seawalls need to be built. This makes me think that urban planning is actually a kind of ‘data-driven art’.\n3. Human-centred\nThis assignment made me think that although data and technology are important, they ultimately serve people. The government can use remote sensing data to optimise urban planning, but if people are not willing to change their habits, it may be difficult to implement policies.\nBut if ordinary people are allowed to have access to this data, will it lead to better decision-making?\nIf everyone can view the greening rate and heat island effect index of their neighbourhood through Google Earth Engine as such, this can raise public awareness of environmental protection. If these data are more transparent, citizens may be more willing to participate in urban planning rather than just passively accepting policies.",

Expressed in policy research, GEE data can be used to analyse the relationship between air pollution and urban population density, providing a scientific basis for urban environmental managers.PCA can also be used to downscale multi-band remote sensing data and extract the main components to simplify data analysis. Through PCA analysis, the bands that contribute most to the urban heat island effect can be identified. In this way, it also contributes to the ‘prioritisation’.\nAnother interesting application for me is flood risk assessment. By combining Landsat imagery, DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) and precipitation data, it is possible to monitor in real time the extent of flood damage. Using the reduceRegion() function, it is possible to calculate the historical frequency of floods in a given area and assess the future risk, which is important for emergency management and disaster warning.",

I think this is a great approach.\nIn the future, I hope to do more in-depth research in conjunction with GEE, especially the application of machine learning to remote sensing image classification.

    "text": "7.2 Application\nRemote sensing image classification has many practical applications, such as environmental monitoring, urban sprawl analysis, and air pollution research. Taking air pollution studies as an example, we can use LULC data (land use/land cover) to analyse the effects of different surface types on major air pollutants (MAP) and surface temperature (LST).\nPrevious literature has shown that air quality is usually better and temperatures are relatively lower in areas with more urban green space and forest cover. If we combine the data from Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-5P, we might be able to do a regression analysis to see the effect of LULC on pollutants such as PM2.5, SO2 and NO2.\nAlso, forest monitoring is an interesting application, especially for illegal logging detection. I have used Random Forest for classification before, but I didn’t realise that it could be useful in remote sensing image processing. Hansen et al. (2013) used Landsat data to analyse the change of forest cover, and combined with the Random Forest classifier, the accuracy was significantly improved. This got me thinking that if similar methods were used in different regions, they could be used to predict future forest trends.\nThink out loud💡:\nUrban extension studies can also be done with this idea, such as comparing satellite images from multiple points in time to see how urbanisation is changing. Supervised classification methods (e.g. SVM, Random Forest) can be used to improve classification accuracy and also reduce manual misclassification.",

In the training process of these models, K-means and SVM, data quality determines everything, for example, if the cloud mask is not handled properly, the classification results will be messy. When I did machine learning projects before, most of them were dealing with numbers. But this practice made me more deeply appreciate that if the data itself is problematic, the model can’t be saved no matter how powerful it is.\nAnother thing that made me think is that although complex machine learning methods (SVM, Random Forest) can improve classification accuracy, in some scenarios, simple threshold classification is rather more intuitive and effective. For example, if the image data itself is already clear, a simple pixel value thresholding method may be more reliable and easier to interpret than machine learning classification.\nIn the future：\nI would like to further investigate how to optimise the hyperparameters of the classification model to see how different combinations of parameters affect the classification effect.

The core idea of this method is to pick a few endmembers (endmembers) and then calculate the percentage of land coverage for each pixel.

    "text": "8.2 Application\n\nThe methods we learned this week are very effective in Urban Sprawl Monitoring. Like OBIA, you can slice and dice the image into different features, such as high-density housing, commercial areas, green spaces, and so on, without being as prone to error as pixel-level classification. When I used Random Forest before, I felt that sometimes the classification might not be too accurate, but now with the additional spatial information, the identified urban structure is more reliable.\nForest monitoring is also a typical application, especially for illegal logging detection. Traditional pixel-level classification may misclassify mixed pixels (e.g. partially deforested forests), but SMA, a spectral mixing method, can more accurately estimate the proportion of canopy cover, for example, the destruction of the Amazon rainforest can be analysed with Landsat data, providing more accurate information to environmental organisations.\nWater Management can also use subpixel classification. For example, with Sentinel-2 data, we can analyse the different components in a body of water, like suspended sediment, algae and so on, which is still quite effective for pollution source monitoring. Wouldn’t it be more intuitive for a coastal city to use this method to track the spread of pollution than traditional water quality monitoring?",

    "text": "8.3 Reflection\nThe biggest takeaway from this week is that classification is not just about choosing an algorithm, it’s more about using the right method. Pixel-level classification is simple and rough, but sometimes a lot of details will be lost, especially the problem of mixed pixels, OBIA and SMA can analyse the image in more detail, especially SNIC, which is a super-pixel method, a little bit similar to K-means, but it can make the spatial structure more reasonable, and the classification effect is obviously better.\nIn the part of classification accuracy evaluation, the previous modelling only focuses on Overall Accuracy (OA), but actually Producer’s Accuracy and User’s Accuracy are more important. For example, if the mapping accuracy of the ‘green space’ category in the classification is very low, urban planners may make wrong decisions with this data. So, when evaluating a classification model, you should not just look at one metric, but consider all aspects.\nNext (in the future)🪁:\nI would like to try deep learning (e.g. CNN) on remote sensing classification to see if the accuracy can be further improved. At the same time, I also want to figure out the effect of end-element selection on spectral mixture analysis, and try different methods to optimise the classification effect. This week’s study made me realise that remote sensing classification is not just as simple as running a model, but more about finding a solution suitable for practical applications.",

    "text": "9.1 Summary\nThis week’s topic revolves around urban temperatures and their analysis by remote sensing, focusing on the use of Landsat and MODIS data to measure the urban thermal environment and to combine statistical methods and machine learning models for analysis. In addition to basic temperature extraction and time-series analyses, the course introduces the calculation of the Heat Index and discusses the impact of historical Redlining policies on urban temperatures.\nIn terms of data processing, this week attempted to use Landsat 8 and MODIS (Aqua & Terra) data to extract the Land Surface Temperature (LST) of Beijing, combining the high resolution of Landsat with the high temporal resolution of MODIS to obtain a more comprehensive temperature monitoring result. At the same time, the data is pre-processed by Google Earth Engine (GEE) to ensure accuracy and usability.\nThe most interesting part of the week for me was Time series analysis and spatial statistics: - Time series analysis of MODIS: to observe the trend of summer temperature. - Calculation of average temperatures for different administrative regions based on Landsat and exporting the data for further analyses (e.g. calculating temperature percentiles in R). - Heat index calculation: Use Landsat data to construct a temperature scale to classify the city’s ‘heat risk class’ by percentile.",

    "text": "9.2 Application\nThis week’s knowledge can be widely applied to Urban Heat Island (UHI) studies, environmental planning, and climate adaptation strategies.\n\nUrban Heat Island Effect Monitoring\nThis week, we learnt how to use MODIS long time series data to analyse the trend of urban heat island effect, and combined with Landsat fine-grained data to study microclimate impacts. By comparing data from different years, it is possible to identify areas of significant temperature increase and further explore the relationship with land use change, such as which neighbourhoods are more susceptible to heat due to a lack of greenery.\nUrban planning and public health\nHigh temperatures not only affect comfort, but are also linked to socio-economic factors and the health of the population. We will examine the long-term impact of ‘Redlining’ policies in the context of heat exposure in poor neighbourhoods, and use hospital emergency data to assess the public health risks of heat, in order to develop more appropriate cooling strategies for cities.\nData Processing and Machine Learning\nOptimisation This week’s heat index calculation is similar to a classification problem and can be combined with K-means clustering, decision trees (CART) or deep learning (CNN) to improve the accuracy of the analysis. In addition, temperature trend analyses via Mann-Kendall trend tests can provide data to support future urban planning and policy making.\n\n💡:\nLandsat has high spatial resolution but low temporal resolution, suitable for local fine analysis; MODIS has high temporal resolution but low spatial resolution, suitable for large-scale analysis.\nThe calculation of the heat index can be adjusted, e.g. different regions may need different temperature thresholds to avoid ‘one size fits all’ grading.\nIn the future, Night temperature data (MODIS LST Night) can be added to explore the influence of day-night temperature difference on the thermal environment.",

    "text": "9.3 Reflection\nThis week has made me more aware of the importance of remotely sensed data in urban environmental monitoring, especially in addressing climate change and urban heat island issues, which can provide more comprehensive and detailed analyses than traditional weather stations. In addition, the high temporal resolution of MODIS makes me more interested in time series analysis, and in the future I would like to try to apply machine learning to temperature prediction, such as LSTM or ARIMA to predict the future high temperature trend of the city.\nHowever, the whole data processing process is still quite complicated, especially when implementing temperature calculation, heat index grading and other operations in Google Earth Engine (GEE), the code logic needs to be adjusted repeatedly. If we want to do a larger-scale analysis of the urban thermal environment in the future, we may need to combine Python with automated batch processing to improve the computational efficiency.\nThis week’s study has given me a deeper understanding of Geospatial Data Processing and Time Series Analysis, and a clearer idea of the direction in which remote sensing technology may be applied in the future!",
